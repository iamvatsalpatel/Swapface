You can find the video demonstration of the project from [here](https://github.com/iamvatsalpatel/Swapface/blob/main/Implementatio%20Video.mov).

## Note
In the 'app' folder, the sub-folder 'dat' is empty as file in it was big and I was not able to upload the file. But, you can download the file from [here](https://github.com/tzutalin/dlib-android/raw/master/data/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat) and put it in the 'dat' folder.
